  <h1>Using the Query String to Customize a Page</h1>
<p>Let's say you want to make a browser-based interface for a device. Here's a way to get load the interface in your browser from your device using a QR code.</p>

<p>Step 1: generate an HTML page and serve it from a server. It's easier to maintain this page if it's a static page that doesn't change for each device that wants to use it as an interface.</p>

<p>Step 2: generate the page's URL on the device's screen, so you can scan it with your phone. Here's an <a href="https://github.com/tigoe/html-for-conndev/tree/main/queryString/SSD1306_QRCode_redirect">Arduino sketch for a SSD1306 OLED Screen</a> that'll do just that. </p>

<p>Step 3: add any parameters that are specific to the device (like its IP address or other ID) to the query string of the URL before you generate the QR code.</p>

<p>Step 4: modify the HTML page using client-side JavaScript to that it can extract the query string and its parameters and adapt itself to the specific device that you want to interact with. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/tigoe/html-for-conndev/tree/main/queryString">source code of this page</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the query parameters from your call for this page:
  <div id="queryParams"></div>
